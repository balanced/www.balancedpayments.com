		    How does Balanced combat fraudulent activity?
		    <span class="bookmark" id="22638611">[+]</span>
		  </h3>
		  <p>While Balanced utilizes a variety of powerful tools to detect fraud it is impossible to wipe it out entirely. Marketplaces should also evaluate the unique aspects of their services to help minimize fraudulent activity such as by imposing limits on new customer activity and monitoring the geo-location of users.</p>

		  <h3>
		    How are credit card chargebacks and disputes handled?
		    <span class="bookmark" id="22640072">[+]</span>
		  </h3>
		  <p>In the event that a buyer initiates a chargeback or dispute with the credit card issuer, Balanced will notify the Marketplace via email. The Marketplace should notify its seller/merchant of the dispute and request as much information as possible with which to fight the chargeback. The Marketplace should collect all the relevant information and provide it to Balanced within 15 days. Ideally the chargeback will be rejected in which case the Marketplace keeps the funds. If, however, the chargeback is successful, Balanced will debit the payment amount from the Marketplace&#39;s bank account. Depending on the Marketplace&#39;s policies and the nature of the dispute, the Marketplace may wish to pass on the chargeback amount to the seller.</p>

		    What are the terms of service for a marketplace?
		    <span class="bookmark" id="22659926">[+]</span>
		  </h3>
		  <p>Marketplaces must agree to the Balanced&#39;s <a href="http://www.balancedpayments.com/terms/marketplaceagreement%60">Marketplace Agreement</a>. An important term in the agreement is that the marketplace must include the following snippet of terms and conditions in its own Terms of Service which covers the relationship between the marketplace&#39;s customer and Balanced:</p>

		  <blockquote>
		    <p>[Client] uses Balanced as its third party service providers for payment services (e.g. card acceptance, merchant settlement, and related services).  By making use of some or all of these payment services on [Client] you agree to be bound by Balanced’s terms and conditions (available at <a href="https://www.balancedpayments.com/terms">https://www.balancedpayments.com/terms</a> along with its privacy policy: <a href="https://www.balancedpayments.com/privacy">https://www.balancedpayments.com/privacy</a>) and hereby consent and authorize us to delegate the authorizations and share the information you provide to us with our Third Party Service Provider(s) to the extent required to provide the Payment Services to you. Balanced may also be contacted directly for payments support either by email at <a href="support@balancedpayments.com">support@balancedpayments.com</a> or by phone at +1 (888) 744-2622</p>

		    Do marketplaces using Balanced need to provide 1099s to merchants?
		    <span class="bookmark" id="23986672">[+]</span>
		  </h3>
		  <p>Marketplaces processing their merchants’ transactions through Balanced do not need to submit 1099s. Balanced, not the marketplace, is responsible for submitting tax forms to the IRS for all transactions that we process. Filings are only required for merchants processing &gt;$20,000 from at least 200 transactions, and Balanced will submit a 1099-K to the IRS and the merchant.</p>

		  <p>At the moment, marketplaces and sellers (i.e. merchants) must satisfy the following 3 requirements to use Balanced: 1) U.S. bank account; 2) a company registered in the U.S. with an EIN number; 3) a company representative that is a permanent U.S. resident.</p>

		  <p>Balanced can process transactions from buyers residing in nearly any country and using any Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover card (debit and credit).</p>

		  <p>Balanced does not get involved with the calculation of sales tax. The marketplace should determine if sales tax is applicable, the amount and include it in the total charge amount. As a Payment Service Provider, Balanced provides Form 1099K in certain situations, typically for sellers who exceed 200 transactions and $20,000 in transaction volume in one year.</p>

		  <p>We have discussed offering micro-transaction pricing in the past, but reached the conclusion that it doesn&#39;t make sense for us financially at the moment. There are, however, work arounds that you could use. Our CEO discussed a few of these at length on <a href="http://www.quora.com/Balanced/Does-it-make-sense-to-use-Balanced-with-micro-transactions/answer/Matin-Tamizi">Quora</a>.</p>

		    Can I use Balanced for recurring or subscription billing?
		    <span class="bookmark" id="24001027">[+]</span>
		  </h3>
		  <p>Balanced is great for your recurring and subscription billing. When you store credit card information in the Balanced server, it stays stored there indefinitely, and you can make an API call to debit that user again whenever it makes sense for your business model (i.e. for later purchases, on some recurring schedule, etc).</p>

		  <p>Currently you have to explicitly make an API call each time you want to make another debit, so this takes some logic on your end. We’re working on a way of automating various sorts of recurring payments. Please add your voice to the <a href="https://github.com/balanced/balanced-api/issues/40">GitHub issue</a> about the subject, if you’d like to see such a feature.</p>
