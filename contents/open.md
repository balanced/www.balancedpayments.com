  bodyHeader: Full openness for Balanced goes beyond sharing information inside the company; you're sharing information with the world.
  body: |
    Troubled by the closed-off culture of the financial services industry where information was guarded for competitive advantage, Matin Tamizi, Co-founder & CEO of Balanced, was inspired by the open-source efforts of [App.net](https://join.app.net/) and [Gittip](https://www.gittip.com/)—companies that shared product specifications, open-source code, and even product roadmaps out in the open. It was an entirely different take on building an open company.

    Recognizing the tremendous value of direct feedback, Balanced wanted to incorporate the voice of the community as an integral part of the company’s decision-making process.

    How do you release something and determine if that’s what your customers want when you’ve dedicated tons of time to building it properly? Once it’s in the open for the world to see, you have to race to get it done and get it done right. But openness also affords you the opportunity to up your game and hold yourself accountable to the quality of work you produce in order to ensure everything is running smoothly.

    Embracing “openess” forced Balanced to formalize internal processes and articulate the reasons behind a decision. The community now had public channels, through [Github](https://github.com/balanced), [Quora](http://quora.com/balanced), and [IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=balanced), to share their thoughts and help Balanced determine the validity of a feature.

    Being “open” has created a dramatic shift in Balanced’s development process. Anyone can now propose an enhancement on [Github](https://github.com/balanced), giving Balanced the opportunity to continually iterate before writing a single line<br />of code. The process was formalized:

    + Create a public issue
    + Discuss it publicly
    + Prioritize it publicly
    + Define specs or mocks publicly
    + Implement
    + Release
    + Communicate the release publicly
    + Communicate that the enhancement has been made

     Every change that affects the customer's experience is always proposed externally. Furthermore, it’s publicly prioritized and set into milestones with deadlines so everyone can see what we’re actively working on.

     Each public comment encourages additional people to participate in the discussion. By the time the development phase begins, everyone has had the chance to share their thoughts. If a request is not prioritized, we could point customers to a Github discussion so they may understand why the decision was made.

support:
  bodyHeader: Use highly public customer support.
  body: |
      We’ve seen how openness fosters enthusiasm and support. Balanced maintains an active [IRC support channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=balanced) with [chat logs](https://botbot.me/freenode/balanced) available to the world. There are about 50 people on IRC—only five of whom are Balanced employees. Customers like [ajsharp](https://github.com/ajsharp), [joonas](https://github.com/joonas), and [secforus](https://github.com/SecurityForUs) have become some of Balanced’s most vocal advocates. They help answer questions and provide code snippets to other users. Some customers have even publicly explained, on Quora, [why they use Balanced](http://www.quora.com/Balanced/Why-do-you-use-Balanced-for-payments).
